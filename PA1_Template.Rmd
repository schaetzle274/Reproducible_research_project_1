# Loading and Prozessing the data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/chris/Documents/AI Training/AI Training/AI_course/Reproducible_research_project_1/Data/repdata_data_activity/activity.csv")
activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))
activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

## data without NAS
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
```

# Calculating the mean of the total numbers of steps per day and plot it in an histogram

```{r}
#total Number of Steps per day
sumTable <- aggregate(activity$steps ~ activity$date, FUN=sum)
colnames(sumTable)<- c("Date", "Steps")
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day")

#calculating the mean
as.integer(mean(sumTable$Steps))

#claculating the median
as.integer(median(sumTable$Steps))
```

# Calculating the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
##average number of steps per interval
intervalTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

##plot of average number of steps per interval
p <- ggplot(intervalTable, aes(x=interval, y=Avg), xlab = "Interval", ylab="Average Number of Steps")
p + geom_line()+xlab("Interval")+ylab("Average Number of Steps")+ggtitle("Average Number of Steps per Interval")

##Maximum steps by interval
maxSteps <- max(intervalTable$Avg)
##Which interval contains the maximum average number of steps
intervalTable[intervalTable$Avg==maxSteps,1]
```

# Imputing missing values

## Calculate and report the total number of missing values 

```{r}
# Calculating the number of NA`s
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
```

## Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Filling in NAs by substitute the missing steps with the average 5-minute interval based on the day of the week.

```{r}
## Create the average number of steps per weekday and interval
avgTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval, day), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

## Create dataset with all NAs for substitution
nadata<- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]
## Merge NA data with average weekday interval for substitution
newdata<-merge(nadata, avgTable, by=c("interval", "day"))
```

Creating the new dataset with the NAs included.

```{r}
## Reorder the new  data 
newdata2<- newdata[,c(6,4,1,2,5)]
colnames(newdata2)<- c("steps", "date", "interval", "day", "DateTime")

##Merge the NA averages and non NA data together
mergeData <- rbind(clean, newdata2)
```

Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
sumTable2 <- aggregate(mergeData$steps ~ mergeData$date, FUN=sum)
colnames(sumTable2)<- c("Date", "Steps")

# Mean of Steps with NAs
as.integer(mean(sumTable2$Steps))
# Median of Steps with NAs 
as.integer(median(sumTable2$Steps))

# Creating the histogram of total steps per day, categorized by data set to show impact
hist(sumTable2$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="red")
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="blue", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed Data", "Non-NA Data"), fill=c("red", "blue") )
```

The new mean is 10821 steps. Compared to the old mean of 10766 there is a difference of 55 steps on average per day.
The new median is 11015 steps. Compared to the old median of 10765 there is a difference of 250 steps for the median.
But the shape of the distribution has not changed.

# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
mergeData$DayCategory <- ifelse(mergeData$day %in% c("Samstag","Sonntag"),"Weekend","Weekday")
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 
type = "l"\color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}
type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
library(lattice)
intervalTable2 <- ddply(mergeData, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))

#Ploting the data in a panel plot
xyplot(Avg~interval|DayCategory, data=intervalTable2, type="l",  layout = c(1,2),
       main="Average Steps per Interval Based on Type of Day", 
       ylab="Average Number of Steps", xlab="Interval")
```

Yes, there ist a difference between weekdays and weekends.
